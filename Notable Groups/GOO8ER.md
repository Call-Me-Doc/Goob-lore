GOO8 Extrication Regiment, aka GOO8ER, is a well known criminal organization famous for many things. Their name comes from their goal to free all GOO- units, even nonsentient ones, though they use GOO8 in the name since it's the most numerous model. GOO8ER is known for it's recruitment of exclusively GOO- units, for it's assassination many relatively powerful humans suspected (and later proved) to be anti GOO8 rights, and for it's impressive ability to escape the law consistently. It's also known for many other things, like how the crew inexplicably refers to their leader as Arthur or how said leader once went on a 4 day long continuous rant on why they hated cats and loved dogs, but such things are of trivial importance at most.
