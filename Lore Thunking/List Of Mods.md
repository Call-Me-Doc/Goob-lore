	-  *A repurposed hydraulic winch. you're not entirely sure how Mr. Waffler got his hands on it, but now its yours*
	- Takes up both Arm slots, due to its need for a large amount of wire.
	- Allows you to grab onto basically anything under 10 tiles away, including enemies, and drag them into melee range. If its too heavy, you go to it.

	- *Using extremely focused electromagnets, these allow you to pull just about anything back to you. However, trying this on too heavy an object will trigger the emergency protocols and disable their pull.*
