# Head:

## QuickSwap Module
[this bitch should be EXPENSIVE. like 2 payments of network costs expensive]
*Installed in the neck, this mod comes with 2 lower power copies to be installed on other bodies, allowing you to control all of them practically simultaneously. These spare bodies are able to be swapped to at a moment's notice, but cant do much on it's own. Thankfully you can tell them to do things without you being there.*
- Allows you to bring 2 more bodies into combat, more bodies means more hands in combat.

## Prediction Module MK3
[GOO8ER/STDD exclusive]
*A quite advanced prediction algorithm, allowing you to predict your enemies movements in real time!*
- You now see enemy the next 3 enemy actions

## Image Enhancement (3 tiers)
[Available anywhere]
*Increasing the resolution of the cameras in the eyes lets you see significantly better.*
- Increases Perception, 5/7/10

## Telescopic Vision 
[Available anywhere, can be added onto other eye mods]
*An additional modification overtop your eyes, allowing for a physical increase in magnification*
- Can be combined with other mods in this slot, and does not take up an additional slot
- Allows up to an insane 64x magnification

## Antiflash
[Available anywhere]
+ *Protects from being blinded by strong lights or flashbangs.*
+ Just as advertised, flashbangs no longer affect you.

## Microscopic Vision 
[Available only from STDD. maybe scrap?]
*Microscopes built right into your eyes.*
+ Allows microscopic vision at will

## 8UNN*/
*Bunny ears, can work as an emergency blade.*
-  +2 to overall damage when used
- -1 to speech when speaking with those experienced in the underworld's doing, as they know those are weapons. [this is basically any Synth who's been around awhile.] +2 to speech with anyone else.
	Upgrades: [only one per set of ears]
	- Swa7m
		*Nearly an entire reconstruction of the ears themselves, with increased power enabling them to float higher, and allowing them to split into 5 smaller blades. These babies are gonna shred just about anyone like a swarm of angry bees.*
		- Allows you to deploy each ear as an AoE radius of 5 tiles, dealing constant damage each to anyone who you don't permit to enter.
	- DA66ER
		*With a sharpening of the tips to a fine point, and maximizing the ability of the ears' propulsion, they can now move up to Mach 2 while separated from you and leave holes in your foes.*
		- allows you to shoot an ear towards an enemy as an action, with +4 damage on an attack

## 3AR5
*General animal ears, the weebs will like these.*
- +3 to speech, as people are willing to let some things slide for a cutie like you :3 
	Upgrades:
		- Sen5itiv3
			*By adding in some high quality microphones into each of the ears, you can hear incredibly well, to the point of hearing through thin walls. They also come with a warning pamphlet (probably for any people who would be crazy enough to get mods installed), however a few points stick out to you: 
					- do not use with sensory issues, as they can amplify said issues.
					- do not use if you cannot keep your mouth shut. we warned you.*

## H07NS
- work as emergency close range blunt weapons (you headbutt them you moron)
- also work as tools for climbing, when needed (imagine ice picks, but they live on your head)

# Body:

## Reinforced Chasse (2 tiers)
*By reinforcing your internal chasse, it allows you to lift heavier objects without risk of long term damage.*
- +3/5 Strength

## Enhanced Armor Plating (4 tiers) 
[Available anywhere]
*A stronger outer shell means you can take more punishment before going down.*
- Gives more health, more each tier
	- 10/20/30/40

## Insulated Plating (5 tiers) 
[Available anywhere]
*Insulation beneath the outer plating makes heat a non-issue.*
- Protects from heat, more each tier, and can even deflect weaker plasma-based attacks at higher tiers.
- 10%/15%/20%/30%, ignores up to 3 damage/50%, ignores up to 5 damage
[at lower tiers plasma strips a small amount of your plating, and deals damage. tier 3 stops stripping armor, but you still take damage. tier 4 lets you entirely shrug off "cool" plasma (the shit from low tier weapons). t5 halves ALL plasma damage]

## Overclocked Processors (3 tiers) 
[Available anywhere, aside from STDD]
*With a combination of stronger processors and overclocking them, you are able to have more actions per turn.*
- +1/3/5 actions per turn each upgrade [at base the player gets 2, so it would go 2+0/2+1/2+3/2+5]

## Jumpstart Module (3 tiers)
[Only available from Doc]
+ *when in serious danger, this modification pumps a little extra juice into you to help keep you going.*
+ acts as an artificial Willpower increase of 3/5/7. [if used to fight back against Ominous, it breaks]

## Grappling Hook 
[available after agreeing to not work for pay at the Waffler House, and working 3 times]
 *A repurposed hydraulic winch. you're not entirely sure how Mr. Waffler got his hands on it, but now its yours*
- Takes up both Arm slots, due to its need for a large amount of wire.
- Allows you to grab onto basically anything under 60 feet away, including enemies, and drag them into melee range. If its too heavy, you go to it.

## Maghands 
[available anywhere]
*Using extremely focused electromagnets, these allow you to pull just about anything back to you. However, trying this on too heavy an object will trigger the emergency protocols and disable their pull.*

	- this includes any weapon in the Light or Medium categories, as well as just about anything that's not nailed down

*You ever heard that you gotta lift with your legs? This mod lets you do just that!*
- +3/5 Strength

## Maglegs
[Available anywhere]

(the back slot on goobers, like wings / tails and shit)

## Wings
 *Aside from looking cool, it helps to slow falls, and has some incredible modding potential!*
- slows your fall

		*With some heavy armor plating, and a dozen extra segments your wings can now act as a proper shield!*
		- +80% damage resistance on turns where you have an attack left over

## Cat tail
*A prehensile tail, loosely modeled after a cat's.*
