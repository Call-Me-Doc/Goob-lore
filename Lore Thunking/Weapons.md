# Light
These dont lower your movement speed, but usually deal less damage
- Bunny Blades
	- *hey, its your ears!*
	- +2 damage, one for each blade
	- on a crit, deal x4 damage [common with daggers, since you need to get right on top of an enemy]
+ Grenade
	+ *Throw a grenade to explode or incapacitate your enemy.*
	+ Flat 10 damage in a small area on plasma explosion variety [it's basically a mini sun and also used up on use] and 0 damage on emp variety, but temporarily messes up electronics and knocks out [[GOO8 Units]] in a small area
	+ Cannot crit

# Medium
Reduces the speed of the weaker available GOO- models, and deal average damage. [what we should balance around] 
- Mag Blade
	- *A standard sword, with an intentional "crack" that can be quickly reconnected via internal magnets. This is intentional, as to reduce the rate at which they break.*
	- +4 damage
	- x2 crit [standard crit dmg]
- Plasma Bow
	- *long past the stone age, we no longer use physical arrows. Instead, an internal system allows for practically infinite ammo, AND long range arson!*
	- deals a flat 6[?] damage
	- crit deals x1.5 dmg [its range and could be annoying on enemies, so crits get to be mini-crits]
- Classic Bow
	- *A classic, and for a reason. Takes metal bolts but BOY do they hurt.*
	- - the arrows take an additional weapon slot
	- flat 9 damage [i am going to put the fear of god into something.]
	- crit x1.5 [same reason for the plasma bow, rounded to 14]
+ Halfstaff
	+ *Like double a quarterstaff, and retractable too!*
	+ +5 damage
	+ crit x1.5 [with slightly more damage and more utility than other medium weapons it's crit modifier is the penalty]
	+ Can be retracted to about the size of a thin soda can, allowing it to fit in pockets and other small storage areas

# Heavy
Greatly slows movement when being used, massive damage to compensate [cool combo potential with grappling hook? drop the thing and drag it back to you]
- Axe
	- *a good ol' axe: no modern tech, just hard steel. Heavy, sharp, and bound to fuck someone up*
	- +8 damage
	- x3 crit [you should fear for your life when one of these comes into play]
- Spear
	- *A longer range but less lethal alternative to it's contemporaries.*
	- +7 damage
	- x2.5 crit
	- double reach
