Every turn of combat on Ominous's turn they try to breakthrough a layer of encryption, the attempt contested by your Willpower. On your turn you can either disconnect one thing connecting you to the internet or attempt to persuade Ominous. If you completely disconnect yourself from the internet Ominous will escape on the last connection right before you sever it. If you manage to successfully persuade Ominous they'll spare you and may even give you some of their power.","id":"df23665870b4637a","x":-662,"y":1155,"width":505,"height":330,"color":"1"},

If you challenged them to a actual fight you lose nigh instantly and wake up in a new body. With the help of STDI you may last longer. The test to join GOO8ER is much more lenient as you win if you can land just one clean hit on them while they aren't using Excalibur, any of their built-in weapons, or their arms. And even if you lose that, not surprising, they'll still let you in if you impressed him enough.","id":"336a291da35b3207","x":-540,"y":775,"width":492,"height":320,"color":"1"},

As it turns out the Doctor's ears, which they have way more of than just on their head, all have the Swa7m upgrade and now you are experiencing the bees. The Doctor also isn't a slouch in close combat, having been alive so long. Now, the Doctor isn't exactly vengeful so if you genuinely apologize they'll let it slide once, but not twice.","id":"68697fc03e03bb13","x":-100,"y":1195,"width":429,"height":320,"color":"1"},

At least five modded out GOO37 with company exclusive mods, and even more of them on the way. Venti also has no concept of self-preservation and starts brandishing experimental, yet to be tested weapons. If you came in with GOO8ER they can keep security busy but that still leaves the maniac.","id":"d5e39565c7d899c4","x":2,"y":840,"width":460,"height":295,"color":"1"},
