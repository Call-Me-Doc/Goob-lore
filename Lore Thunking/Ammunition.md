# Plasma Cartridges
+ Basic
	+ The cheapest and easiest to find option, but with no special effects
+ Overcharged
	+ Fires a more powerful arrow but shooting too many times without cooldown damages the bow
+ Multishot
	+ Splits the bolt into multiple, weakening each individual arrow but makes the bow a shotgun so it can hit multiple targets at once or one multiple times at once
+ Non-Lethal
	+ Fires the electromagnetic field without the plasma making a weak long range taser, accidentally also a precise long range EMP
