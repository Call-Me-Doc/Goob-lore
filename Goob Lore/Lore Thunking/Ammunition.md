# Plasma Cartridges
## Standard
*The cheapest and easiest to find option, but with no special effects*
- deals 6 damage
- does not need to cool, as it recharges faster than even the most skilled shooter's fire rate.
## Overcharged
*Fires a more powerful arrow but shooting too many times without cooldown damages the bow*
- deals 12 damage
-  can only be shot 4 times in succession before needing to be swapped out or risk damaging the bow and cartridge itself (it may explode in your hands)
## Multishot	
*Splits the bolt into multiple, weakening each individual arrow but makes the bow a shotgun so it can hit multiple targets at once or one multiple times at once*
- deals 3 damage, but has 3 projectiles
- requires an additional roll to see where the shots hit
- targets within a 10 degree cone of your selected target can also be hit
## Non-Lethal
*Fires the electromagnetic field without the plasma making a weak long range taser, incidentally also functions as a precise long range EMP*
- deals literally 0 damage
- stuns any target for 8 Actions
- can be fired 3 times before needing to be swapped out or risk damaging the bow and cartridge itself (it may explode in your hands)
## Fire
*Lowering the stability of the bolts after firing allows for the plasma to become much more like its standard form, and thus light your foes on fire!*
- deals 3 damage
- ignites your target, for 2 damage per turn for 5 turns
- can be fired 3 times before needing to be swapped out or risk damaging the bow and cartridge itself (it may explode in your hands)
## Ice
*With a little "special mixture" patented by some random company that nobody really remembers, these allows the flash freezing of body parts without any permanent injury to humans! Unless you aim for the chest or head. That'll still kill someone.*
- deals 0 damage, unless you get lucky.
- freezes a portion of an enemy, restricting their movement until the ice is broken
