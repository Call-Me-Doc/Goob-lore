# Light
1 weapon slot
These don't lower your movement speed, but usually deal less damage
## Bunny Blades
*hey, its your ears!*
- +2 damage, one for each blade
- on a crit, deal x4 damage [common with daggers, since you need to get right on top of an enemy]
## Hidden Blade
 *A knife in your forearm is always cool*
- +1 damage when a weapon isn't in this hand
- x4 crit [same as above]
## Dagger
*standard little dagger, some think that they're useless when dealing with larger weapons, but a good hit will do as much, if not more than said weapons.*
- +3 damage
- x4 crit
## Collapsible Plasma Bow
 *by making the bow collapsible it reduces overall storage profile, but also lowers draw distance.*
- crit deals x1.5 dmg [its range and could be annoying on enemies, so crits get to be mini-crits]
- 45 foot range [.75x of base]
# Medium
2 weapon slots
Reduces the speed of the weaker available GOO- models, and deal average damage. [what we should balance around] 
## Mag Sword
 *A standard sword, with an intentional "crack" that can be quickly reconnected via internal magnets. This is intentional, as to reduce the rate at which they break.*
- +4 damage
- x2 crit [standard crit dmg]
## Plasma Bow
 *Long past the stone age, we no longer use physical arrows. Instead, an internal system allows for practically infinite ammo, AND the use of special ammo types!*
- deals damage based on plasma type loaded into it, standard plasma deals 6 damage
- crit deals x1.5 dmg [its range and could be annoying on enemies, so crits get to be mini-crits]
- 60 feet of range [other bows work off of this distance]
## Classic Bow
 *A classic, and for a reason. Takes metal bolts but BOY do they hurt.*
- - requires quiver
- flat 9 damage [i am going to put the fear of god into something.]
- crit x1.5 [same reason for the plasma bow, rounded to 14]
## Halfstaff
- *This "Halfstaff" is actually just a quarterstaff, but it's marketed as being twice as good as a normal quarterstaff. It's not, by the way, it's just marketing.*
+ +5 damage
+ crit x1.5 [with slightly more damage and more utility than other medium weapons it's crit modifier is the penalty]
+ When you end a turn with an attack with this weapon, you gain 20% damage resistance
+ Can be retracted to about the size of a thin soda can, allowing it to fit in pockets and other small storage areas. [this makes it count as a light weapon storage wise]

# Heavy
3 weapon slots
Greatly slows movement when being used, massive damage to compensate [cool combo potential with grappling hook? drop the thing and drag it back to you]
##  Axe
 *A good ol' axe; no modern tech, just hard steel. Heavy, sharp, and bound to fuck someone up*
- +8 damage
- x3 crit [you should fear for your life when one of these comes into play]
## Spear
 *A longer range but less lethal alternative to it's contemporaries.*
- +7 damage
- x2.5 crit
- double reach
## Greatsword
 *A two handed greatsword. If you need more of a explanation than that you shouldn't be wielding this.*
- [reskin of axe? no clue on what to do with this]
## Heavy Plasma Bow
 *By increasing overall profile, it allows the bow to hold 2 separate Plasma Cartridges and swap between them on the fly via the flick of a switch, along with greater flight range.*
 - can hold an additional Plasma Cartridge
- crit deals x2 dmg [big bow gets a little more damage]
- 90 feet of range [1.5x]
