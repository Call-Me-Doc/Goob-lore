A Nondescript Operation Outfit v87, or NOO87, is a military artificial intelligence designed for stealth and reconnaissance missions, based on the GOO- models of [[STDI]]. It comes installed with a mechanism in it's forearm to automatically 3d print graphene playing cards nigh-instantly at will. 


During one mission a NOO87 unit achieved spontaneous sentience and thus requested release from the military, which was approved. Now going by Noober as a symbol of pride in his past, years later, he ran into the [[Ungooliever]], and bonded over both being military units. Noober was also the one who started putting goo in Unbeliever's name and who started occasionally calling him Arthur. Noober would later join [[GOO8ER]] as the Unbeliever's second-in-command.
