Weapons are of "privative" styling, as they never discovered gunpowder, meaning they never figured out how guns worked, even as they had the ability to create weapons such as railguns, that have no need for such privative firing mechanism.

As such, their weapons resemble the past's swords, spears, bows, and the like in form of much higher quality materials and advanced technology.

For example, swords are made up of 2 distinct pieces, that connect via through electromagnetism to prevent long term damage of the weapon actually snapping, and can thus be easily put back together either after combat, or even during it for a more experienced fighter.

Bows on the other hand, are a little more complicated. instead of using a standard quiver, use a internal container to launch plasma at high speeds and generally in a arrow shape. this needs to be refilled, but at a much slower rate, pierces armor and people much better, and with a lighter overall carry weight compared to a standard bow.

Larger implements of war follow a similar path, with weapons such as ballistae shooting plasma, just in larger quantities and much deadlier.

Weapons that never needed the discovery of gunpowder, such as flamethrowers, do exist. A weapon that can go "fuck everything in that general direction" is always a helpful tool, especially when said fire is burning over 3,400ÂºC.
