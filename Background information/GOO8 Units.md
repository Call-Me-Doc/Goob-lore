GOO8 units, also known as "Goobs" by the greater populous are humanoid artifical intelligences that, while origionally intended for warfare, have now entered more civillian life, as assistants, carers for the elderly, and general companions. 


An exremely small portion of them have acheived true sentience though a process neither they nor their creators understand. To avoid any problems that a practically enslaved group could cause, major governments gave those who proved to be truely sentient proper citizenship, on par with normal humans.

As they are a very cheap to produce item, they are extremely customizeable and reproducable. Due to this, many establishments having powered off GOO8 units on hand, and cloud technology, sentient GOO8 units are very hard to truly "kill". Even if you do manage to kill one, a backup created moments before its death will just inhabit a vacant body nearby, and will usually be quite pissed. this is normally because Sentient Goobs have aftermarket parts installed to allow for enhanced functions, such as more recent ports, as GOO8 units still have outdated chargers that are 7 years older than the existence of Goobs themselves.


The "Hair" on GOO- units are actually a large amount of extremely thin displays, capable of showing nearly anything that the unit can get. Normally, the "Hair" displays a base color of the owner's choice, the logo of STD, following where an eye would be, and other potentially helpful information. In units who are sentient, their "Hair" varies wildly from unit to unit, most of them, however, settle for a symbol that they belive represents them the most to replace STD's.
