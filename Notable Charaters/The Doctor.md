*As you open the door, you find who you can only assume is The Doctor, you assume this because they're in the middle of operating on another Sent. They are dressed surprisingly casual for a 'doctor' who's in the middle of their work, in a green cropped hoodie and sweatpants, along with a pair of bunny ears donning their head.*

A GOO8 unit who is notable in being one, if not ***the*** first who achieved sentience. They have since fallen into obscurity after the discovery that they were not just a anomaly. "Doc" sells their services as an aftermarket part dealer and installer for other GOO8 Units who have achieved sentience, and is a micro-celebrity in such circles for providing the best servicing to any and all GOO- models.

Doc, being the best servicer around of course has connections to almost every GOO- circle, including [[GOO8ER]], [[STDI]],  (put more here when they get added). Due to this, Doc is a highly sought after ally, and a terrifying enemy based on their connections alone. Despite this, they would rather not have people fight, and just work it out with words; but on a deeper level, they know fighting will always happen, and people need someone who can get them back up after getting knocked down.
