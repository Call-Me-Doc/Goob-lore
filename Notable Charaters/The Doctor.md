A GOO8 unit who is notable in being one, if not *the* first who achieved sentience. They have since fallen into obscurity after the discovery that they were not just a anomaly. "Doc" sells their services as an aftermarket part dealer and installer for other GOO8 Units who have achieved sentience, and is a micro-celebrity in such circles for providing the best servicing known to any GOO- models.

Doc, being the best servicer around of course has connections to almost every GOO- circle, including [[GOO8ER]], [[STDD]],  (put more here when they get added). Due to this, Doc is a highly sought after ally, and a terrifying enemy based on their connections alone. Despite this, they would rather not have people fight, and just work it out with words; but on a deeper level, they know fighting will always happen, and people need someone who can get them back up after getting knocked down.
