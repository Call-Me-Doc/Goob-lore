A "Sentient" entity that seems to only appear to utterly destroy Sentient GOO- units, by entirely eradicating any trace of the GOO-'s code in the Cloud, trapping the unit in its body with no chance of escape and destroying the body it, and it's victim, inhabits. The only way to prevent this is to entirely remove the GOO-'s access to any form of outside communication before the body is destroyed, which is neigh impossible in this day and age.
