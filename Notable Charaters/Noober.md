A Nondescript Operation Outfit v87, or NOO87, is a military artificial intelligence designed for stealth and reconnaissance missions, based on the GOO- models of [[STDD]]. It comes installed with a mechanism in it's forearm to automayically 3d print graphene playing cards nigh-instantly at will. During one mission a particular NOO87 achieved spontaneous sentience and as such issued for release from the military, which was approved. This NOO87, now going by Noober as a symbol of pride in his past, then ran into the [[Ungooliever]], being the one who started putting goo in the name and also the one who started calling him Arthur, and quickly formed a close bond with the fellow military unit. Noober would later join [[GOO8ER]] as the Unbeliever's second-in-command.
